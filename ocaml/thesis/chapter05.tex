\chapter{Conclusions and future work}

We designed and implemented algorithms for verifying timed and time abstracted
relations on pairs of timed automata, and provided reference
implementations for STaB, TaDB and TaOB. However, some scope for
further work remains.

\begin{itemize}
\item Using the framework we have developed for verifying timed
  relations, such as time abstracted bisimilarity from
  \cite{DBLP:conf/cav/GuhaNA12}.
\item Investigation along the lines of the original zone-valuation
  graph algorithm in \cite{DBLP:conf/cav/GuhaNA12} in order to see if the
  efficiency of this algorithm can be improved while retaining
  correctness.
\item Investigation along the lines of proving cycles cannot exist in
  the product LTS of two zone-valuation graphs in order to simplify
  the current algorithm for verifying relations by omitting cycle detection.
\item Cleaner code through better integration with the UPPAAL
  libraries for DBM operations and parsing of timed automata, and with
  Ocamlgraph, a set of Ocaml libraries for implementing common
  operations for graphs.
\end{itemize}
