\begin{abstract}
  This describes the author's work in implementing the construction of
  zone-valuation graphs for timed automata and using these to verify
  certain relations on pairs of timed automata.
  Timed automata are a widely-used formalism, in verification, for
  describing systems where the execution is subject to timing
  constraints. One area of interest is the verification of certain
  timed and time abstracted relations on pairs of timed automata,
  which are generally of either an equivalence nature or a
  pre-ordering nature. Among existing tools, minim
  \cite{tripakis2001analysis} serves to verify certain of these
  relations, but it is limited in its scope and fails to meet certain
  requirements of reachability in its output. We build upon the work
  of \cite{DBLP:conf/cav/GuhaNA12}, in which algorithms for building
  zone-valuation graphs (minimal, discrete equivalent representations
  of timed automata) are given and used to verify certain pre-ordering
  relations on pairs of timed automata. We present an modified version
  of the zone-valuation graph construction algorithm, and a
  generalisation of the algorithm which uses zone-valuation graphs to
  verify a larger set of timed and time-abstracted relations on timed
  automata, where this generalisation builds upon the work of
  \cite{arun2006bisimilarities}. We also describe a reference
  implementation of these algorithms in Ocaml.
