\section{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}

\item To develop a software toolkit that would enable users to verify
  various timed relations specifications and implementations expressed
  as timed automata.

  \begin{itemize}

  \item To gain an understanding of the theory related to labeled
    transition systems, CCS processes and timed automata by surveying
    relevant literature.

  \item To study tools already built by researchers for similar purposes.

  \item To develop the software in a modular way with modules for
    language specification and modules for implementations of utility
    algorithms.

  \item To implement algorithms for determining timed relations.

  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{CCS processes}

\begin{itemize}
\item A CCS process is an automaton with state and interfaces for
interaction. 
\item The interaction is in the form of \emph{actions} over
communication ports known as \emph{channels}. 
\item Given a port name $a$ we refer to $a$ as the label for input on the port
  and $\overline{a}$ as the label for the output on the port.
\item \emph{Inaction}: This is the simplest CCS process, denoted by
  $0$. No state transitions or communcation can occur, in other words,
  this represents a deadlock.
\item \emph{Prefixing}: This is the simplest constructor; if $P$ is a
  process and $a$ is a label (input or output) then $a.P$ is also a
  process which can perform the action $a$ in order to become the
  process P.

\item \emph{Naming}: We can give names to processes using syntax such as \\
$N \overset{def}{=} a_1.a_2.....0$ \\
This gives us the ability to define CCS processes recursively, such as
this one:\\
Parrot \overset{def}{=} $a.\overline{a}$.Parrot

\item CCS expression: Defined by the following grammar:
\begin{itemize}
\item $P::=K$
\item $P::=\alpha . P$
\item $P::=_{i \epsilon I} P_i$
\item $P::=P|Q$
\item $P::=P[f]$
\item $P::=P\L$
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Equivalences on CCS}

\subsection{Trace equivalence}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Trace equivalence: $Traces(P) = Traces(Q)$
  \item Unsatisfactory (differences in deadlock
    behaviour.)
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Strong bismilarity}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Strong bisimulation: A binary relation $R$ is a \texttt{strong
    bisimulation} if and only if, for all $(s_1, s_2) \epsilon R$ and $a \epsilon Act .$\\
    $\forall s_1' (s_1 \xrightarrow{a} s_1' \Rightarrow \exists s_2'
    . (s_2 \xrightarrow{a} s_2' \wedge (s_1', s_2') \epsilon R ) )
    \wedge $ \\
    $\forall s_2' (s_2 \xrightarrow{a} s_2' \Rightarrow \exists s_1'
    . (s_1 \xrightarrow{a} s_1' \wedge (s_1', s_2') \epsilon R ) )$
  \item It can be shown that the union of all strong bisimulations
    over the set of states is a strong bismulation. This binary
    relation is called \texttt{strong bisimilarity}, denoted by $\sim$.
  \item Better notion of equivalence than trace
    equivalence: picks up differences in the deadlock
    behaviour of processes under study.
  \item Failing: does not account for the
    invisible nature of $\tau$ transitions in CCS processes.

  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Weak bismilarity}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Weak bisimulation: A binary relation $R$ is a \texttt{weak
    bisimulation} if and only if, for all $(s_1, s_2) \epsilon R$ and $a \epsilon Act .$\\
    $\forall s_1' (s_1 \xrightarrow{a} s_1' \Rightarrow \exists s_2'
    . (s_2 \overset{a}{\Rightarrow} s_2' \wedge (s_1', s_2') \epsilon R ) )
    \wedge $ \\
    $\forall s_2' (s_2 \xrightarrow{a} s_2' \Rightarrow \exists s_1'
    . (s_1 \overset{a}{\Rightarrow} s_1' \wedge (s_1', s_2') \epsilon R ) )$
  \item It can be shown that the union of all weak bisimulations
    over the set of states is a weak bismulation. This binary
    relation is called \texttt{weak bisimilarity}, denoted by $\approx$.
  \item Better suited to CCS processes,
    as it ignores $\tau$ transitions, thus disregarding hidden
    behaviour within a process.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Kanellakis and Smolka's algorithm}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item This is a naive algorithm for determining the bisimilarity
    relation for the set of processes in a labelled transition system.
  \item This relies on the notion of a splitter.
  \item Let $\pi = \{ B_0, ..., B_k \}, k \ge 0$ be a partition of the
    set of states $Pr$ in a labeled transition system.
  \item A splitter for a block $B_i$ $\epsilon$ $\pi$ is a block $B_j$
    $\epsilon$ $\pi$ such that for some action $a$ $\epsilon$ $Act$, some
    states in $B_i$ have $a$-labelled transitions whose targets lie in
    $B_j$ while other states in $B_i$ do not.
  \item This suggests a refinement of $\pi$: replace block $B_i$ with
    \\
    $B_i^1 = B_i \cap T_a^{-1}[B_j] $ \\
    $B_i^2 = B_i - B_i^1 $ 
  \item Refinements of this kind constitute the steps of this
    algorithm.
  \item The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(mn)$, since there
    can be at most n iterations, and all m edges are scanned in each iteration.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Fernandez' algorithm}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item More efficient algorithm (O(m log n)).
  \item Relies on Paige and Tarjan's technique of three-way splitting.
  \item Splitters can now be 'simple' or 'compound'.
  \item Stability: A partition $\pi$ is said to be stable with respect to a
    compound block S if S is not a splitter for any block in $\pi$ for
    any action.
  \item For a compound block S, having a constituent simple block B
    satisfying $n(B) \le 0.5*n(S)$, and with respect to which $\pi$ is
    stable, we can split a block $B_i$ on an action $a$ as follows:\\
    $B_i^1 = (B_i \cap T_a^{-1}[B]) - T_a^{-1}[S-B]$ \\
    $B_i^2 = (B_i \cap T_a^{-1}[S-B]) - T_a^{-1}[B]$ \\
    $B_i^3 = B_i \cap T_a^{-1}[B] \cap T_a^{-1}[S-B]$ \\
  \end{itemize}

\section{Timed automata}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Formally, a timed automaton over a finite set of clocks $C$
    and a finite set of actions $Act$ is a 4-tuple $(L, l_{0}, E, I)$.
  \item $L$ is a finite set of locations.
  \item $l_{0}$ is the initial location.
  \item $E \subseteq L \times B(C) \times Act \times 2^{C} \times L$
    is a finite set of edges.
  \item $I: L \rightarrow B(C)$ assigns invariants to each edge
    location.
  \item $B(C)$ is the set of clock constraints over C. An element of $B(C)$
    can be an equality, a slack inequality, a strict inequality, or
    an AND combination of such constraints.
  \end{itemize}
